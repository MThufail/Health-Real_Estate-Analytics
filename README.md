### Health Analytics

#### Project Overview

This project focuses on health data analytics using the R programming language. The primary goal is to explore and analyze health-related datasets, specifically examining factors that may influence health outcomes. The analysis includes loading and summarizing health data, fitting linear regression models, computing confidence intervals, and evaluating model performance using various techniques such as validation set approach, LOOCV, k-Fold Cross-Validation, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and more.

#### Key Features

- Loading and summarizing health datasets using the `readxl` library.
- Fitting linear regression models to understand relationships within the data.
- Utilizing various model validation techniques to evaluate and compare model performance.
- Exploring polynomial models, including quadratic and cubic, to capture non-linear relationships.
- Implementing Ridge and Lasso regression for regularization and feature selection.
- Assessing and comparing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of different regression models.

#### Conclusion

The analysis concludes by identifying the most effective regression model for the health dataset. The project provides insights into predictive modeling and serves as a guide for health-related analytics using R.
